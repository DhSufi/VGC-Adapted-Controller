# VGC-Adapted-Controller (Beta)

A script that allows people with disabilities to play Pokémon VGC.

Using an Arduino board to emulate a controller, you can use this script that reads your mouse position and press controller buttons.

Then using the amazing software called CameraMouse (http://www.cameramouse.org/) you can move the mouse over the screen and just play Pokémon

Tutorial coming soon. Still beta.
